# The Wretched of the Earth: Preface

> Preface by Jean-Paul Sartre (book by Frantz Fanon)

## Tom’s Presentation

### Background

There are a lot of Marxist influences on Fanon’s writing. Fanon talks a lot about the French, but never addresses the book to the French. The book is really about the colonized and the colonizer. Why should the French, the oppressors, read it? Sartre: to understand mainland France, they have to see the hidden truth in the colonies. Europe is headed toward ruin, because colonialism is tarnsihing its soul.

### The Cycle of Violence

First, the French view the natives as an opportunity to educate. Second, they viewed them as failed Europeans, because they didn’t really want the natives to be their equals anyway. They viewed them as not really human, but not really beast.

The French talk about humanism, and they did not view natives as human. They could not kill them, because they needed their work. The violence created by the colonizers has a boomerang effect: the colonizers create it and then it comes back. The violence returned by the natives is used by the French to invalidate the natives’ image even more. They fail to see that the violence is their own.

### The French Response

“Come now, if you’re not a victim when your government commits genocide, then you are undoubtedly a torturer, and when you try to play victim, you are trying to take the easy way out.” (p. 59?) Even those who support the native cause are benefitting from colonialism. Sartre kind of thought himself outside of the question as a French person, often addressing the French in second person.

French officers who commit tortures have nightmares and beat their wives, because their violence is a way of destroying themselves and their old psyches. Sartre: the days when Europe was the main character are over. Now the third world asserts itself on the main stage.

### Violence as Necessary

Do you agree with Sartre’s diagnostic that violence was always inevitable? Does this invalidate nonviolent protesters like Martin Luther King Jr?

What about people like Sartre? How can they support the oppressed while being in the community of the oppressor? Sartre says that when French people protest, and suffer for the cause of natives, they are only doing it to feel better about themselves.

Nate: “The Europeans create an environment for violence, and are surprised when violence occurs.” This is Sartre’s point exactly.

### Looking Ahead

You will understand why Fanon’s view is a little bit different from “an eye for eye.” How is it different from revenge? Keep this in mind while reading Fanon’s *On Violence.*Glenn said that you have 3 options when part of an opressing group:

1. resist
2. complicit
3. participate

French soldiers overseas cannot commit heinous crimes while acknowledging that the natives are human beings. Military soldiers are given orders to mentally dehumanize colonized people. The choices Glenn gave are kind of bad either way. Either you die, or you degrade yourself to no longer man (as the natives).

True resistance fighters know that they will die for their cause. There is no “might die.”

You who are so humane pretend to forget that you have colonies that committed murder in your name. Have the courage to remember it because you will feel shame, and shame is a revolutionary feeling.
