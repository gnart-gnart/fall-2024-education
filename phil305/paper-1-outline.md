# P305 Essay 1 Outline

## Introduce Philosophical Problem
What makes a science a science and why does this matter? Why is it important? Your argument of why theory 1 is better than 2 will relate to why it is important to demarcate science from not science.

What is science? Studying reality. The discussion of science vs. psuedoscience is really a disagreement over what is real. For astrologists, the connection between the stars and our minds is real. For creationists, the Christian God that created the universe is real. The only fundamental disagreements between proponents of one science-or-psuedoscience and another, are those about what they believe to be true. In this way, science is purely a social construction, and whatever the definition of science *truly* points to is up to you.

I want to be careful to avoid saying that there are no rules with any of this or no patterns, or that this whole question of what makes a science a science doesn't matter because it's all just social phenomena.
