# Lakatos Argument and My Response

## Lakatos

1. Science is objective (does not depend on human belief).
2. Science involves theories confronting facts.
3. Scientists are stubborn (so Popper is wrong).
4. The Lakatos theory is as follows:
   1. The descriptive unit of great science is a research program.
   2. There is a core of the program, such as Newton's tenets, that are protected by a ring of auxiliary hypotheses.
   3. Progressive research programs predict novel facts. (24)
      1. Degenerative research programs fabricate theories to address known facts.
      2. Scientific revolutions involve progressive research programs overtaking degenerative ones.
      3. Programs may take decades to get off the ground; be lenient with newbies.

## Problems

1. He never really addressed the problem of induction within his argument.
2. He claims that science is independent of human belief, then describes research programs that completely rely on human minds. No scientist studies something he doesn't believe in. Even if his research program theory is correct, no scientist tries to progress a research program that he or she doesn't believe in. Science is initiated by the creativity of a scientist, and it eventually leads to a research programme. But was Einstein not doing science before his single theory evolved into a program? He was doing science.
