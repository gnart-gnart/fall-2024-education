# Dual-Aspect Monism (or Panpsychism and Panprotopsychism)

> From Morch 4-4.2 (Week 4)

## What is dual-aspect monism?

The claim reality consists of one fundamental kind of stuff, which has two different aspects *throughout*: a physical aspect and a mental—or protomental—aspect. Protomental things are non-physical precursors to fully mental things. Dual-aspect monism implies panpsychism since everything has both aspects.

## What is panpsychism?

The view that consciousness is everywhere. One variant is *panprotopsychism*, which is the view that protoconsciousness is everywhere. In this view, even non-living entities, such as fundamental particles, have some fundamental form of consciousness (or protoconsciousness). Complex consciousness, such as human and animal consciousness, is in turn taken to result from fundamental consciousness or protoconsciousness (or the particles possessing it) being put together in the right way.

## Dual-aspect monism and physics

Under dual-aspect monism, physics only tells us how reality is from the *outside*. The reason everything has protoconsciousness is because protoconsciousness is the *intrinsic* nature of physical properties. This implies that physics is purely structural or relational.

Every outside needs an inside—every relation needs relata—with intrinsic properties. We can measure the outside with physics, but the only inside we know is ourselves. We are aware of our own consciousness and its phenomenal qualities. Because our own consciousness seems intrinsic, it could be that phenomenal consciousness is the intrinsic property of everything physical.

## Dual-aspect monism, precisely

Dual-aspect monism can precisely be defined as the view that:

1. Phenomenal properties are not physical, but rather either fundamental or constitued by protophenomenal properties.
2. Physical properties are relations between, or structures of, phenomenal or protophenomenal properties.

From (1) and (2), it follows that everything physical is also mental or protomental.
