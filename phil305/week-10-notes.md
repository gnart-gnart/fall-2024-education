# Dissecting the Holistic Picture of Scientific Change

> Larry Laudan

## Introduction

Laudan wants to use Kuhn's work as an example to show how the features of the reticulational model can be used to produce a better model of scientific change than Kuhn's model.

## Kuhn on the Units of Scientific Change

The Kuhnian paradigm has three markers:

1. <u>ontology</u>: gives a conceptual framework for classifying and explaining natural objects
2. <u>methodology</u>: specifies the appropriate methods and tools of studying the objects
3. <u>cognitive goals</u>: have ideals, some of which are unique to rival paradigms

Kuhnian paradigm changes are *simultaneous,* not sequential. They are abrupt and global ruptures in scientific communities. To Laudan, it is a problematically irrational process.

<u>By insisting that change only happens between, rather than within, paradigms, Kuhn makes it impossible to rationalize paradigm changes.</u>

## Loosening Up the Fit

Kuhn's big picture of theory change looks like this:

Worldview 1 (ontology 1, methodology 1, values 1)

​	⬇

Worldview 2 (ontology 2, methodology 2, values 2)

As such, you cannot choose which theory is better than the other, because you wonder: "better according to which standards and whose goals?" Kuhn also suggested that each paradigm automatically satisfies its own standards and fails the standards of rival paradigms. Kuhn had turned science into an irrational "monster."

Kuhn even said that Priestley should hold onto phlogiston theory as Lavoisier, Dalton, and friends converted to oxygen theory. Because according to Priestley' own cognitive goals, his theory continued to look good. The implication is that interparadigmatic debate is irrational.

## Laudan's Ammendments to Kuhn's Position

1. Replace the hierarchical view of justification with the reticulated picture
2. Drop Kuhn's insistence on the integral character of world views

The various components of a world view should be individually negotioable and replacable. Paradigms are too complex with too many interconnections among ontologies, methodologies, and values to be wholly packaged together.

Laudan's picture of theory change looks like this:

(ontology 1, methodology 1, values 1) → (ontoloy 2, methodology 1, values 1)

If theory change occurs one level at a time, then it can be a rational process.

> <u>Interesting aside from class</u>: At the time of Newton, we wanted a mechanistic explanation for everything. Opium made us sleepy because it had a dormative property is an illegimate explanation because it is not mechanisic. Newton seeked a mechanistic explanation for gravity, which he could not find. So scientists gave up their old values without changing their theories. Objects have gravity. Why? They just do. Katherine disagrees and said that we are still trying to find a mechanism for gravity. She says we should not value the intrinsic property explanations.

## Laudan's Idealized Picture of Scientific Change

The example: there is the collective C1, containing T1, M1, and A1 (theory, methods, axiology or values). A1 justifies M1 and harmonizes with T1; M1 justifies T1 and realizes A1; T1 constrains M1 and exemplifies A1.

Say there is a new theory T2. The rules M1 will be consulted and might even prefer T2 over T1. Eventually, a new method M2 is proposed. A1 and T2 are consulted to see whether M2 is better than M1. If so, M2 replaces M1. Scientists can even abandon A1 in favor of A2 if A1 is inconsistent or later found to be fundamentally incorrect.

When Tom the historian studies the shift from C1 to C2 (T2, M2, A2), it may seem much more revolutionary and dramatic than it actually was. The goal of the rest of this chapter is to argue that this picture is more accurate than Kuhn's holistic picture.

> Kara said that in adopting Laudan's method, we have lost the historical justifications of each paradigm piece. When we get to C2, we have lost all original justifications from C1. Carlos asked if it matters, since for all x in {T, M, A}, x2 is consistent with x1. Tom doesn't see the problem either, because it seems like we are assuming everything should only be justified by one thing. But Kara's concern is that we have lost what was the initial justification of T2, but Tom thinks it's fine because we have a whole new justification of T2.

> Ben wonders: are we not keeping some parts of x1 inside of x2? Sansom thinks that that works for M and A, but not T. Theories are singular. According to Ben, 2 out of 3 factors being at least partially the same as the predecessors is enough to no longer be worried about losing justifications. William compared this discussion to the Ship of Theseus.

## Why is Piecemeal Stronger than Holistic?

Historically, collectives don't change all at once. The theory, methodology, and values can change one at a time. Kuhn's analysis suggests that methods, values, and theories cannot change independently, which is wrong.

<u>Example</u>: Bacon, Hume, and Newton used the same standard rules to exclude unovervable entities from their science. They only valued observable entities. By the late nineteenth century, this value had vanished from major scientists like Whewell, Peirce, Helmholtz, Mach, Darwin, and Hertz, who believed it fine to postulate unobservable entities.

This is a shift in methodology of a scientific community—from eliminative induction to the method of hypothesis. But it was NOT linked to any Kuhnian revolution.

## A Change in Aims or Values

Is it more plausible that changes in value always involve changes in methods and theories?

<u>Example</u>: Science abandoned "infallible knowledge" as a value while keeping the same theories and methods. Peirce and Dewey argued for this.

This change in values was not accompanied by any major revolution or paradigm change. Therefore, it counters Kuhn. The holistic approach is confounded by history. The three levels are interrelated, but not inseparable.
