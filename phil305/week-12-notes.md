Deductive nomological explanation can sometimes be deductive nomological prediction. Thesis: **An adequate explanation is an adequate prediction and vice versa.**

## Introduction

This is the conjuction of two subtheses:

1. every adequate explanation is potentially a prediction
2. every adequate prediction is potentially an explanation

The first subthesis is sound, and the second is open to question.

Any rationally acceptable answer to the question, “Why did event X occur?” must offer information that shows that X was to be expected (at least within reasonable probability).

This can be extended to explanations about laws, but these cannot really be predictions because laws are timeless uniformities.

The point of an explanation is different than the point of a prediction because if one asks for an explanation, they usually assume the explanandum is true.

## Objections to Subthesis 1

Subthesis 1 says that any adequate explanatory argument is also potentially predictive.

### Objection 1: Paresis and Syphilis

Scriven argued that the occurence of event X is sometimes adequately explained by: “The only cause of X is A,” e.g. “The only cause of paresis is syphilis.” This is a presumptive explanation which is not a potential prediction.

Counter: Because paresis is such a rare sequal to syphilis, syphilis alone cannot even be an adequate explanation for paresis.

### Objection 2: Evolution Explained

Toulmin argued that Darwin’s evolution theory explains the origin of species by natural selection, but is never used to predict new species.

Counter: Hempel distinguishes between the *story* of eveolution and the *theory.*The story is a narrative describing the stages of the evolutionary process. The theory is what explains it. The story tells us that dinosaurs made their appearance at a certain time, and died at a later time. It does not eplain why they appeared or disappeared.

To truly account for the extinction of dinosaurs, we need a vast array of additional hypotheses about their biology, environment, competing species, etc.

If we had all of these theories in addition to evolution, maybe we could explain the dinosaurs’ extinction, but that would also be predictive.

> Tom mentioned that this implies that we don’t have an adequate explanation for *many* things. The bar for what is “adequate” is raised really high.

### Objection 3: Jealousy and Metal Fatigue

Sometimes the only explanation for an event involves the fact that it happened at all. Scriven’s example: a man kills his unfaithful wife. The explanation is his jealousy. However, we can only know that this jealousy is intense enough to kill the wife if he does it.

Another example: the collapse of a bridge was caused by metal fatigue. The cause could have been an excessive load, external damage, or metal fatigue. But it can only be known to be metal fatigue when the bridhe collapses and the first two causes were not present.

Counter: Hempel’s point is that an adequate explanatory argument could have predicted the explanandum event *if* the explanans had been known before the occurence of the event. Sometimes we do not know that all the explanans are realized, but that only means that the if-clause is not satisfied, not that the thesis is false.

The explanandum event occuring does not by itself support the explanatory hypothesis, but it constitutes an essential part of the only evidence availaable in support of that hypothesis.

### Self-Evidencing Explanations

$D–N$ explanations in which $E$ being true is an essential part of the only available support for one of the explanans, say $C_1$, are self-evidencing. It is not a circular or pointless argument.

Example: some skin cancers come from intensive ultraviolet irradiation. But this factor often does not lead to cancer.

Some people are radiation-sensitive. If someone is radiation-sensitive and exposed to ultraviolet irradiation, that is a valid explanation for the event occuring.

## The Second Subthesis

Every adequate predictive argument also affords a potential explanation.

This is open to question. Example: an early symptom of measles is Koplik spots. The statement L, that the appearance of Koplik spots is always followed by the later manifestations of the measles might therefore be taken to be a law. It can be used to predict that someone with Koplik spots will get measles. However, exceptions can happen, so predictions do not necessarily equate to explanations.
