# Two Basic Types of Scientific Explanation

> Carl G. Hemper

## Deductive-Nomological Explanation (group 1)

The bubbles on a hot glass breathe out when put on a cold plate, because of heat. The “explanandum-event” can either consist of:

1. particular facts, or
2. uniformities expressed by general laws.

A deductive argument may exist in this form:

(D)

C1, C2, …, Ck

L1, L2, …, Ly

E

Where there are particular facts (C), general laws (L) that jointly form the explanas. The conclusion E explains the explanandum.

This is deductive-nomological explanation. Deductive because causes and explanation. Nomological because there are laws (that are crucial to the deduction).

### Continued (group 2)

An explanation is often conceived as a cause, or causes. A cause is more than this: a complex set of particular circumstances. Whenever the circumstances C1…Ck arise, the explanandum-event will follow.

We speak of causes about particular facts or events, not universal facts or general laws. The laws connect the explanandum event with the particular conditions cited in the explanas. 

Causal explanations do fit this model, but most explanations do not. For example, the gas law links temperature, pressure, volume, and mass. The gas law is not a causal law because the cause does not preced effect. All causes happen at the same time.

## Probabilistic Explanation (group 3)

Sometimes, explanandum events are probable, not causable, like when 8 milligrams of antihistamine is used to treat hay fever: doesn’t *always* work. This is the probabilistic statistical model (or the inductive statistical model).

(P)

Fi (C1…Ck in D)

p(O,F) is very high

Oi (explanandum)

In the case i, where C1…Ck happen, the probability of the outcome O happening due to F is very high, and this explains Oi.

> Jerry asked, “How high is very high?” Hempel said, “close to 1,” but Jerry worries that there is a lack of specificity in Hempel’s model. Louie suggested we can deduce a probability, but Sansom said that we are trying to deduce (or explain) J.D. getting better. Ben is worried that inductive statistical model is purely about epistemic probabilities, not real probabilities. Sansom believes if you do a double-blind test (the gold standard), you will get information about epistemic probabilities.

## Elliptic and Partial Explanations: Explanation Sketches (group 4)

Deductive-nomological explanations are similar to mathematical proofs, because they are complete and include premises and conclusions. A math proof includes all explanas, but elliptic explanations do not.

An elliptic explanation omits mention of certain laws or particular facts which it tactily takes for granted, and whose inclusion would yield a complete deductive-nomological argument.

Judged by ideal standards, elliptically formulated explanations include:

1. A lump of butter melted because it was put into a hot frying pan, or
2. a small rainbow appeared because the sunlight was reflected and refracted by water droplets.

### Partial Explanation (group 5)

Freud’s Freudian slip: he wrote the wrong data; he wrote the date he subconsciously wished it were, rather than the date it was. It is partial because it can only explain that subconsciousness can govern our actions, but it does not explain why he wrote the specific date. It is a categorical explanation, not a particular one.

They provide complete, or conclusive, grounds for expecting s to be a member of F, and since W is a subclass of F, it follows that the explanandum (or s) falling in F means it falls in W.
