### Main Points
<u>Thesis</u>: Decolonization is **necessarily** violent.
1. Because it is the substitution of one species of mankind by another.
2. The eventuality of this creates fear in the colonizers.
3. The colonist *knows* the colonized because he invented them.
4. He derives his value from the colonial system.
5. Decolonization is the creation of a new man.
    1. Because it fundamentally alters the colonized person.
    2. It turns them from nonessential to priviliged actor.
    3. Gives them the spotlight of history.
6. "The Last Shall be First"
7. Any decolonizaiton, at a descriptive level, must be good (give the definition).
