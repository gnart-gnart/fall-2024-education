# Week 9 Notes
## McMullin on Kuhn's 5 Values of Science
1. Accuracy
2. Explanatory Power
3. Scope
4. Simplicity
5. Fruitfulness

(1) and (2) are definitive of science. If you're in the business of developing accurate theories with explanatory power, you're in the business of science. (3), (4), and (5) are means to the ends of (1) of (2).

McMullin interpreted Kuhn as suggesting that science should be Rational but deny Realism. But McMullin believes science should involve Realism:
1. Its goal is to say what is in the world
2. It has been approaching that goal throughout history

Kuhn denies Realism by not giving any way to say that paradigm 1 is better than paradigm 2 (because there are no objective standards). So, within a paradigm, science may progress, but universally there is no way to know that that is the case. Paradigms are incommensurable (they cannot be comeasured).

## Laudan - Demystifying Underdeterminism
Underdetermination - evidence isn't enough to make one theory better than another.

Humean Underdetermination - for any body of evidence, there are infinitely many theories that are consistent with that evidence. It's another way of thinking of the problem of deduction.

Laudan agrees with this, but thinks it used too broadly, because:
1. It only applies to deductive logic (is the data consistent with the theory?)
2. Just because there are infinite theories that fit data, doesn't mean there aren't any theories that don't fit.

Quinean Underdetermination - any theory can be reconciled with denying evidence by adjusting auxiliary hypotheses (lowkey from Duhem but Quine brought it to the English world).

How can we know that you can always make a theory compatible with any evidence? Laudan's proof: You can always eliminate an auxiliary hypothesis necessary to go from the theory to the prediction.

Egalitarian thesis: every theory is equally supported given any evidence. This is the most radical form of underdetermination: evidence cannot compell one theory over another. How unscientific!

A theory can ___ evidence.
- be compatible with
- entail
- explain
- empirically support

If we induce a theory from data, Laudan's view is that that data is not supporting of that theory. The data *entails* the theory, but doesn't *empirically support* it.

#### Laudan's other Values of Science (Kuhn didn't cover everything)
1. Internally consistent
2. Surprising predictions
3. Broad support

These can give unambiguous support of one theory over another. You can use some set of rules to choose one theory over another, just as when we chose Newton's Earth shape over Descartes' Earth shape, based on evidence and rules that we agree on. It doesn't prove the better theory, but makes it obvious that it is, in fact, better.

Global underdetermination is not possible in Laudan's view.
