# PHIL 305 Paper 1 Notes

## Theories from Class

### Popper
Falsifiability.
You must be willing to make a novel prediction and fail.
### Kuhn
Normal science is scientific.
Puzzle solving assuming accepted theory.
Keep the core tenets; adjust auxillary hypotheses.
### Lakatos
Progressive research programs. Discovers and predicts novel facts.
Degenerative research programs respond to facts.
### Thagard
A psuedoscience is less progressive than alternatives, but proponents don't care.
A theory can go from being a science to a not science over time.
### Ruse
Creation science is not a science.
(If defining creation science in your paper, use Ruse's definition.)
Science has all of these things (borrowing from the homies):
1. Assumes laws.
2. Explains and predicts with laws.
3. Testable.
4. Tentative.
5. Integrity.

Creation science has none of these.
### Laudan
Ruse's standards are too low.
Science is the best supported theory (implicit argument).
> Ruse responds to this by saying science IS pretty tentative. And, Laudan's criteria makes creation science bad science, rather than not science at all.

### Moreland
Defended creation science with a lot of logical fallacies.
Science is the most rational approach to studying stuff. The source of the theory is irrelevant to science itself.
Allows for the possibility of miracles within a scientific world.
Moreland is in the business of defending creation science, so to filter his arguments on the pure theory of what science is takes some work.

## Paper Instructions
Pick 2 theories, and produce at least one brilliant argument of why one theory is better than the other. Probably will be arguing why one theory is not good.
Your theory can be whatever you like, even a combination of other guys' theories.

To get an A requires proposing a new theory, finding a new position, a brilliant defense or attack on someone else's theory. You must write something *novel*.

Provide an objection to your own argument and refute it. You don't have to propose your own theory but it can help.
