# Week 10 Notes

## Hard Determinism

Sometimes called skpetics of free will, hard determinists argue free will is an illusion and determinism is true (all events are caused by preceding events and therefore inevitable).

1. Compatibilism is false.
2. Libertarianism is false.
3. All that is left is skepticism.

### Galen Strawson's "Basic Argument"

1. Your actions are the result of your nature or character.
2. If you are morally responsible for your actions, then you are responsible for your nature or character.
3. If you are responsible for your nature or character, then your past actions influenced your nature or character.
4. These past actions were the result of your previous nature and character.
5. And so on, so forth.
6. Eventually we will arrive at a first action or character that you are responsible for; ultimately, you are self-caused or it is just absurd (you are responsible for being born!?).
7. Therefore, no one is responsible for anything that they do. Libertarian freedom is impossible.

This is an infinite regress argument. The first statement comes from libertarian freedom, and leads to absurdity.

Paper 2 Topic Idea: You can critique this argument by asking: What do you mean by *character?* This argument stipulates that actions are a result of character. Therefore actions are different from character. What Prof thinks the argument wants to say is that actions are *solely* caused by nature or character, but that's obviously false. If we say that our actions are influenced by our nature or character, then Strawson's argument falls apart. What is Strawson is trying to use character to me the total combination of all your beliefs and desires?
