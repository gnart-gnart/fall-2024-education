# Plato and Aristotle
## Plato's *Republic*
One of Plato's middle dialogues that focuses on justice. He developed theories on forms and knowledge in this dialogue, specifically the analogy of the divided line and the cave allegory.

**Relationalism** (infallibism): P is true iff P appears to the subject as true. (from Protagoras)

- **Naive Realism** is that all there is is just what appears to us.
- Challenge (C): It seems impossible to distinguish good and bad cases.
- Response: Therefore, there is no such distinction.
- Objection: C just implies that we don't know the distinction.
- **Skepticism**: It is impossible to know the reality.
- Response: But maybe there is still the distinction (Disjunctivism)

(Subjective) **Relativism**: P can be true for one subject and false for another subject. Therefore, there is no (objective) truth.

In the good case (reality is real), objects are present. In the bad case (reality is a dream or hallucination), there were objects of experience in the past. For example, if you have a dream of a flying pig, then maybe it is still based in reality (according to Disjunctionists), because at t1 you experienced a pig and at t2 you experienced some birds.

### The Divided Line
The most important thing philosophers should study, according to Plato, is the Form of the Good. A Form is a defining or essential feature of an object. An accidenal feature is something an object can lose, and still be the same, such as the color of a jacket. A Form is shared by all instances of an object.

| World | Objects | States of Mind |
|-|-|-|
| Intelligible World | The Good | |
| | Forms | Intelligence or Knowledge |
| | Mathematical objects | Thinking |
||||
| World of Appearances  | Visible things | Belief |
| | Images | Imagining |

Incompatibilism: The evidence derive from perceptual experience in certain aspects distorts our understanding of what there is in reality, and that the reality discovered through rational inquiry corrects or replaces aspects of what our experience suggests to us there is.

Incompatibilism implies that what is real is just the intelligible, while the perceptible show a distorted version of the same reality.

Reading Reflection: Which of these 2 interpretations does Plato agree with? Incompatibilism or X? [I didn't catch what the other view is supposed to be.]

### Epistemic consequences
The problem of the sturcture of knowledge: If X is founded on Y which is founded on Z, then we have either (a) an infinite regress of knowledge, or (b) a foundation of knowledge, which is grounded on nothing but itself.

Two views:
1. (b) is not possible since we must be able to give an account of whatever we know (534B-C).
2. (b) is possible, as some first principle, i.e. the Form of the Good, can serve as the foundation.
