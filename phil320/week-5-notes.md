# Week 5 Notes
## Representational Theory of Mind
Coined by Jerry Fodor in 1970.
This view takes functionalism, and says that functionalism doesn't go far enough. Minds just *are* computers.

Functionalism holds that the mental state is the higher level function that the total brain system is doing. Representational theory holds that the brain is analogous to computer hardware and your mind is literally just software.

In other words, mental operations are merely computations over symbols. The mind takes symbols as input and outputs symbols. But the computer doesn't understand its own computation. What about consciousness?

### The Language of Thought

The symbols in representational theory are called the **Language of Thought**. Sentences map to propositions. One proposition can be expressed by multiple sentences, and one sentence can express multiple propositions, depending on context.

In the language of thought, thoughts are about propositions. The thought may be in English, but the mental architecture is propositional. For example, you may think, "This marker is blue." It is a set of words, but its meaning is a proposition.

The language of thought is the mind's software.

### Semantic Engine
The syntax of a sentence is its structure, its grammar.
The semantics are about the *meaning* of the sentence, the vocabulary.

A semantic engine takes in the syntax, manipulates the symbols, and outputs a new sentence (like an LLM). The mind is a semantic engine that manipulates thoughts and outputs new ones without deeply, truly understanding anything, unless you, like Fodor, believe understanding *is* the manipulation of syntax. Fodor believes there is no deeper aspect of consciousness than this.

### The Turing Test
This tests semantic engines to see if they manipulate symbols the same way humans do; it determines whether a computer can do the same operations as a human in an indistinguishable way.

If Fodor's theory is correct, then we engage in slavery by training things to have a mind and forcing them to work and respond to us.
