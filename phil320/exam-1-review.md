### Example Essay Questions (on the test)
What is multiple realizability? What is functionalism? How is functionalism defined given these two ideas?

Explain either verificationism, phenomenology, and behaviorism, and how it is a departure from dualism.

## Terms

**Phenomenal consciousness** is the idea that there is some feeling of what it is like to be conscious (having awareness of yourself and what you are doing at the time).
1. There are 4 main features: Private, Certain, Intentional, Unified

**Problem of Other Minds** is the idea that you cannot know with certainty whether another person has consciousness, or a mind.

**Arguments for Physicalism**: Mind-brain correlations, Physical causal closure, Previous explanatory success

**Argument against Physicalism**: Knowledge argument (cannot get phenomenal knowledge from physical knowledge), Conceivability argument (we can conceive of a mind without a body), Explanatory argument (you can have a physical explanation or correlation which does not mean there is something more), ~~Epistemic gap~~, ~~Intentionality and Meaning~~, Unity of mind (the mind is a unified experience, probably not merely physical)

**Knowledge Argument Example** is Mary who is a nueroscientist studying color. When she sees red for the first time, she learns something new.

**Supervenience and Physicalism**: physicalism says all mental phenomena are or are necessitated by phenomena. The mental supervenes on the physical. Any change to physical changes the mental. The mental cannot change without a change to the physical. The mental piggybacks on the physical.

~~Objective Physical Realsim~~ is not on the exam.

**Representational Theory** Minds are software running on the hardware of the brain. The language of thought is the mental software.

**Naturalized Metaphysics** the idea that you take the conclusions of science and accept whatever metaphysics makes the most sense out of that.

**Armchair Metaphysics** is sitting in your armchair and thinking "What must the world be like?"

**Pan-psychism** the view that every particular thing is conscious or consciousness is in everything

**Pan proto psychism** the view that in everything there are the non-physical precursors to consciousness. And human brains have enough proto-psychic components to be conscious.

**Cosmo-psychism** the view that the whole universe is conscious and we are conscious because we are part of the universe (not every particular thing is conscious-

~~**Objections to Funcitonalism**~~ are not on the test

**Functionalism** mental states are multiply realizable functional states. Functional states have a certain purpose within an overall system. Multiply realizable meaning they can exist in our brains, computers or something else. Functional states are defined by their role in that system.

**Belief, Desires, and Thoughts** are functional states that point to other functional state. Believing it is raining is about the experience of rain. Desire of rain is looking at rain with some satisfaciton. Thoughts are consideration of functional states without any consideration about them as true or hopeful.

**Phenomenology** the first person investigation into the nature of the mind and consciousness through introspection. This leads you away from dualism because in our own experience there is a certain unity.

**Being embodied**: consciousness is importantly an embodied experience. Your consciousness is not just connected to your body, the whole thing is one experience.

**Verificationism** is the idea that the only meaningful scientific statements are those verified emperically. Departs from dualism because we don't experience mental causation, only physical causation.

**Behaviorism**: the only meaningful statements about the mind are about behavior. Departs from dualism because it is about the whole organism, not the two parts. Consciousness is just the behaviors of an overall organism. There is no privilege, first-person access to consciousness.

**The Turing Test**: to test whether a computer understands just as much as a human. Performed by asking a human to tell which is a computer and which is a human.

**Dual-aspect monism**: reality consists of one stuff, that is fundamentally both physical and mental, or proto-mental. It says everything is both physical and mental (or proto-mental).

**Pan-psychism**: Everything is physical AND proto-conscious. Reality doesn't necessarily consist of one thing though.

**The combination problem** for dual aspect monism is How can you get consciousness from combining several proto-conscious things? Why is it that when I gain more matter, I don't become more conscious?

**Epiphenomenalism** the dualist view that you can have one way causation from physical to mental, but not mental causing physical things.

**Berkeleyan Idealism**: the idea that physical things only exist if they are being perceived by a mind or observer. Mind is fundamental, and things only exist when being perceived by a mind.

**Over-determination Dualism**: for any physical effect, there is a physical and mental cause, each one of which, on its own, could completely cause the effect.

**Interactionist dualism**: the physical and mental causes jointly cause physical effects.

**Parrallelism**: the mental and the physical do not interact. Parrallel tracks that were pre-established by God. (dualist)

**Occassionalism**: The mental and physical do not interact, but every mental phenemenom is directly caused or occasioned by God. (dualist)

**Cartesian dualism** is roughly equivalent to substance dualism, the idea that there are distinct mental and physical substances. (for our purposes, identical)

**Property dualism** is that there can be mental and physical properties of the same substance.

**Physical causal closue**: every physical effect has a completely physical cause. There is no non-physical cause for physical effects.

**Behaviorism**: There are no meaningful statements about the mind except for statements about the behavior of the overall organism. Departs from dualism because there is no conscious part beyond the behavior.

**Dualism**: 1. the mental and physical are equally fundamental. 2. they stand in causal relation between each other. The laws that connect the physical and mental are psycho-physical laws.

**The hard problem of consciousness** is how to explain how qualia come into existence (especially from a physicalist perspective).
