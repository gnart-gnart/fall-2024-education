# Week 6 Notes
*Euthryphro*, *Gorgias*, and *The√¶tetus* (by Plato)

---
## Euthryphro

Socrates is not pious because he doesn't believe in the gods. But what validates piety? Do the prosecutors have knowledge of piety?

*Euthryphro* is an elenctic dialogue, which means it is a cross-examination or refutation.

| Euthryphro | Socrates |
|-|-|
| Prosecuting out of piety | Being prosecuted for impiety |
| Accepting the authroity of traditional religion | Testing everything (including authorities) by reason |

### Ethical Disagreements

Hard cases (4a-b, e). How do we resolve disputes? (7b-d) How do we know which side is right, and which is wrong?

**Error theory** - there is no such thing as right and wrong, so no ethical judgement is true.

**Ethical relativism** - *every* ethical statement is true -- true for the *individual* who holds it.

**Ethical skepticism** - No one can *know* if an ethical judgement is true even if *it is* true.
