*Euthryphro*, *Gorgias*, and *The√¶tetus* (by Plato)

## Euthryphro

Socrates is not pious because he doesn't believe in the gods. But what validates piety? Do the prosecutors have knowledge of piety?

*Euthryphro* is an elenctic dialogue, which means it is a cross-examination or refutation.

| Euthryphro | Socrates |
|-|-|
| Prosecuting out of piety | Being prosecuted for impiety |
| Accepting the authroity of traditional religion | Testing everything (including authorities) by reason |
