# Week 10 Notes
## Aristotle's Ethics
It is important to distinguish between theoretical knowledge (about the nature of things, like physics) and practical knowledge. Ethics is a practical knowledge whose object is **action**.

### Purpose of Actions

We walk to be healthy. This is the end of the action. In this case, it is not an intrinsic end. The structure of action is you want to walk *to* *be* healthy, *to be* happy.

Why do we do things well or excellently? Excellence (*arete*) is often understood as virtue. There is intellectual excellence and moral excellence.

| Intellectual Excellence    | Moral Excellence                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Comes naturally to humans. | This requires experience and education. |
| Owes much to nature.       | Owes nothing to nature, only to habit.  |

### Aristotle's Argument for Moral Excellence

1. Nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature.
2. We can develop moral excellences or vices by habit.
3. Therefore, moral excellences do not exist in us by nature.

In other words:

1. If we have *X* by nature, then we can't have something contrary to *X*.
2. We can have moral excellences/vices contrary to nature.
3. Therefore, we can't have moral excellences/vices by nature.

Standard argument format: <u>modus tollens</u>. Assume if *P* then *Q*. Deny *Q*. Therefore, *~P*.

Aristotle's argument relies on the metaphysical notion of a strong nature, and some deny this. In this class, we won't go that deep. Note that nature is a necessity, not necessarily a starting point.

### Aristotle's Model for Moral Action

Desire → Perception → Action → Reinforcement Learning → (Alters desire)

Therefore, your desire can be trained by your actions. It is important to educate your desire for moral purposes. And action depends on character. So we must educate the character for moral purposes.

If we are not yet morally excellent, how can we perform morally excellent actions? The proposal is that we become morally excellent by performing morally excellent actions.

Aristotle's response is about <u>intention</u>. To be morally excellent, we must have the active intention of being so. There are two arms to the aforementioned puzzle:

1. If one is completely ignorant about moral excellence, then one doesn't even know how to start any morally excellent action.
2. If one already performs any morally excellent action, then this is a sign that one is already morally excellent.

Aristotle rejects the second arm, because there are cases where someone accidentally performs a morally excellent action, but they have no intention.

### Four Conditions for Moral Excellence

1. The action must be of the *right* sort.
2. The agent *knows* that this is the right sort of action.
3. The agent must choose the action *for its own sake*.
4. The agent's action must proceed from a *stable* disposition or trait.

Some people reject 3, saying that even if everyone does good things, then that's already good enough.
