# PHIL 305 Paper 2

**Thesis**: How does scientific theory change happen and is it rational?

**The prompt**: Why does it matter whether or not scientific theory change is a  rational practice in which new theories are better than old theories? (Introductory question) How does scientific theory change happen? Does the nature of this  process show science to be a rational practice in which new theories are better than old theories or something else? Why?

In this paper you must describe and compare at least two competing views about the answers to these questions. They can both be from  authors we have read or one can be from an author and the other from  yourself or another member of class. You must include an argument why  the view that you prefer is right. IN order to do well on this  assignment something must be novel. Either a position or an argument  must go beyond the texts we have read.

**Other notes**: or two examples to back up your thesis is excellent. (One is great, more than two is not.)

Here’s what Sansom is thinking: did you explain two theories? Strong argument to prefer one over the other? Does it work as a whole? Include something novel (a novel argument or novel theory).

# Review

## Popper

Infinite theories for any given set of data. No universal theory can come from data. Induction is logically problematic. Popper defended *hypothetico deductivism:*

1. Test whether the theory is consistent.
2. Is it empirical (falsifiable by potential data)?
3. Is it an advance of current theories (beyond what we know or contradictory)?
4. Test it (try to falsify it).

## Duhem (phlogiston day)

We’ve got a theory and a bunch of auxiliary hypotheses. Together you can predict results. Popper said invalid results reject the theory, but Duhem said you reject the set of the theory and the auxiliary hypothesis. The data doesn’t tell you which one to reject. Use “good sense” to determine which auxiliary hypothesis to use to save the theory. Bad argument because he never specifically stated what “good sense” is.

## Kuhn

> Kuhn 1 and Kuhn 2 disagree. According to Kuhn, they don’t.

### Kuhn 1

Scientific theory change is paradigm change. You must destroy P1 to adopt P2, because P2 probably rejects P1 if it is really a better paradigm. A paradigm has Theory, Methodology, and Values. V1 supports T1, and V2 supports T2, so it looks like you cannot prove one theory better than another. He had turned science into an “irrational monster.”

### Kuhn 2

Kuhn assured us that everyone had freaked out unnecessarily. There were scientific values that span theory change, such as accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness. These are trans-paradigm values, but reasonable scientists can still disagree about which paradigm is better by applying or weighing these values in different ways. Kuhn argues: thank goodness that scientists can disagree like this, because that allows new and underdeveloped theories to survive until maturity.

## McMullin

Some values, like accuracy, are definitive of science. Other values, like consistency, simplicity, scope, and fruitfulness, tend to exist in good science but not necessarily. McMullin says Kuhn thinks paradigm shift is rational, but is not getting us closer to the truth. He also talks about incommensurability, which means that two theories cannot be comeasured. They cannot be measured by the same ruler. If you look at actual arguments, like Copernicus explained planets orbits the Sun. Tolemey could also predict where the planets would be, but Copernicus could explain it. The success of Copernicus’ argument can only be accepted if you accept that science is about getting closer to the truth.

## Laudan

### Laudan 1

If you look at the details in arguments for underdetermination, it becomes a lot less scary. There are good arguments for weak forms of *underdetermination*— evidence cannot tell you whether T1 is better than T2. *Humean underdetermination*, basically the problem of induction, is real but weak: How many theories are consistent with the evidence? An infinite number. But this is not scary because we can use deduction to rule out an infinite number of theories as well. Quinean underdetermination: all theories are equally viable given any set of evidence, egalitarianism. This is wrong. We can use evidence to clearly favor one paradigm over another, such as when the Cartesian theory and the Newtonian theory clashed about the shape of the Earth, and they discovered the Earth was fat, so the French gave up their theory. There is room for reason and evidence to clearly favor one paradigm over another.

### Laudan 2 (My Favorite!)

Methodoligies, Theories, and Values can change one at a time. The Kuhnian holistic paradigm change is false, and piecemeal paradigm change is true. Tom the historian sees giant leaps, but there was actually a rational progression of intermediate steps. The history of science supports this, because scientists changed from looking for certainty to looking for probability (a change in value) without a corresponding change in theory or methodology. Laudan uses a reticulated (not articulated) model of paradigm shift, as opposed to a holistic model of paradigm shift.

# Outline

## Introduction

Why is it important to know how scientific theory change happens and whether it is rational?

To avoid science being turned into an “irrational monster,” as critics of Kuhn put it. If scientific theory change is a subjective process, then we cannot know objectively which theories are closer to the truth and we will not be able to rely on science for our technology.

## Introduce Kuhn 1

How does Kuhn say theory change occurs? Explain.

## Introduce Laudan 2

How does Laudan say theory change occurs? Explain. Reticulated model.

## Why Laudan 2 is Better than Kuhn 1

**Argue strongly that Laudan 2 is better than Kuhn 1.**

Obviously, Kuhn is incorrect because theory change without value change happens all the time in science. It happens in physics, in the physicist’s never-ending search for a unified theory of reality. One counterexample is sufficient to disprove Kuhn. Take the shift from Einsteinean physics to quantam physics—a change in theory. However, the values of physics did not change. In both cases, the value of the paradigm can be summed up as *the search for the fundamental nature of objects.* An example is not enough to be novel. There needs to be philosophical work.

Kara raised that the justifications had been lost.

## Conclusion

Go back to why scientific theory chage is rational, how it is so, and why that is important. 



# Paper

## Introduction Paragraph

Does scientific theory change need to be rational? I argue yes, because if science were truly an “irrational monster,” as critics of Kuhnian philosophy put it, then we have no metric to decide which scientific theories are *objectively stronger*. A theory that is objectively stronger is:

1. *stronger*, because it better represents what is than competing models, and
2. *objectively* so, because we can tell that it better represents what is.

Why does it matter which scientific theories are better than others? Because the quality of our lives depends on science. Every single technology we use (lights, computers, cars, etc.) exists partly due to the success of certain scientific theories. Engineers create technology based on the best scientific principles they can find. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed in 1940 because the engineers did not understand aerodynamics completely. Since then, engineers have considered torsional forces in their designs. The theory of torsional forces is objectively strong; therefore, bridges built that consider this theory are better, technologically speaking, than bridges that don’t.
